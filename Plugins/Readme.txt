This directory contains sample scripts that demonstrate functionality offered by the Explorer++ plugin API. Currently, the plugin system is in development. There is no way to load any of these scripts directly yet.

You can, however, run the code they contain by going through the following steps:

1. Start Explorer++ with scripting enabled:

explorer++.exe -enable_lua_scripting

2. Open the scripting dialog by going to Tools > Run Script...
3. Paste any commands you want to run in the scripting dialog and press enter (or click the "Run" button).
