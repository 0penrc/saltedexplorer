Resolve Link
------------

This function *resolves* (ie. locates) the target file (or folder) of a
**single** selected :doc:`shortcut <paste_shortcut>`. A new tab is
opened and the target file is selected. Locating the file/folder in this
way is usually considerably faster than navigating to the target
manually.

If the target cannot be located, for example, if it has been deleted, a
Windows error message is displayed which allows you to locate the target
file.
