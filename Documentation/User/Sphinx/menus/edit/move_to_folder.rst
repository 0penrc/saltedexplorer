Move To Folder
--------------

:kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`Shift` + :kbd:`M`

This menu item moves selected files and folders to a different location.
After selecting the files/folders and selecting this item, the user is
presented with a standard *Browse for folder* dialog (see :ref:`here
<menus/tools/options/general:Default new tab folder>` for a picture of
this Windows dialog), allowing the destination location to be chosen.

Using this function is the same as a :doc:`Cut <cut>`/:doc:`Paste
<paste>` operation, but without changing tabs or folders on a tab.
