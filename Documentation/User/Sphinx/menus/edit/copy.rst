Copy
----

:kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`C`

**Copy** places selected items (files and folders) on the clipboard for
subsequent :doc:`pasting <paste>`. The clipboard's contents may be
pasted into the source folder; copies of all items are created.

**Copy** does not delete the original files or folders.

.. note::

  Copying (and :doc:`Pasting <paste>`) files or folders from other
  locations (ie. not the same folder) detects *collisions* (duplicate
  names) and presents the *usual* dialog allowing replacement, if
  desired. Files or folders copied from the **same** folder are renamed -
  Copy of..., Copy (2) of..., etc.
