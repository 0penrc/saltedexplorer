Copy To Folder
--------------

:kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`Shift` + :kbd:`C`

This menu item copies selected files and folders to a different
location. After selecting the files/folders and selecting this item, the
user is presented with a standard *Browse for folder* dialog (see
:ref:`here <menus/tools/options/general:Default new tab folder>` for a
picture of this Windows dialog), allowing the destination location to be
chosen.

Using this function is the same as a :doc:`Copy <copy>`/:doc:`Paste
<paste>` operation, but without changing tabs or folders on a tab.
