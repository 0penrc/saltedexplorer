Cut
---

:kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`X`

The **Cut** operation removes selected files and folders and places them
on the clipboard, for :doc:`pasting <paste>` in a different location.
**Cut** may be used from the files or folders pane.

Items to be cut are still in their original location - they are only
*marked* for cut - until pasted, at which time the originals are
removed. Items cut are **not** placed in the Recycle Bin; they are
:doc:`deleted permanently <../file/delete_permanently>` from their
original location after pasting.
