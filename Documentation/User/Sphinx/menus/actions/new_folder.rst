New Folder
----------

:kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`N`

This menu item creates a new folder in the current folder (tab). The
default name is **New Folder**, but creation of the folder automatically
enters :doc:`rename <../file/rename>` mode: |new_folder| so that the new
folder may be renamed by the user to something more useful.

Creating a new folder inserts it into the file list (Files pane),
obeying the setting of :ref:`Insert new items in their sorted positions
<menus/tools/options/files_and_folders:Insert new items in their sorted
positions>`.
