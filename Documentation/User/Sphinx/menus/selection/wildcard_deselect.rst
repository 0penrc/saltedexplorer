Wildcard Deselect...
--------------------

:kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`Shift` + :kbd:`D`

This menu item allows the user to deselect files (already selected) in
the files pane (ie. current folder) using a wildcard pattern. A dialog
is opened

.. image:: /_static/images/mnu_selection/wildcard_deselect.png

which allows the user to enter a new wildcard pattern, or use the
*drop-down* button and choose a previously used pattern. Clicking OK
deselects files and folders based on that pattern. Repeated use of
**Wildcard Deselect...** is cumulative; additional files may be
deselected, reducing the current selection.

**Wildcard Deselect...** deselects files (and folders) based on file
name and extension.

See :ref:`Wildcard Select...
<menus/selection/wildcard_select:About wildcard patterns>` for examples
of wildcard patterns.
