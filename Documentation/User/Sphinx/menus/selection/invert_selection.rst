Invert Selection
----------------

:kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`I`

Using this function affects the files or folders in the files pane,
causing

- selected files to be deselected, and
- deselected to be selected.

In other words, it inverts that state of selection for all contents of
the current tab.
