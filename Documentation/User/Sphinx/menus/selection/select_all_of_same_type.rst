Select All Of Same Type
-----------------------

This function selects all files in the folder of the same type as the
**one** currently selected. For example, if the files pane (ie.
currently folder) shows multiple types of images, ie. *gif*, *png*,
*jpg*, *bmp*, etc., it is possible to select only jpg images by

- select a single jpg image, by clicking on it
- use this function - **Select All Of Same Type**.

The end result is that all jpg files will be selected.

.. tip::

  **Select All of Same Type** uses the file *type*, as determined by the
  Windows registry - not the file extension! This means, for example,
  that *image1.jpg* and *image2.jpeg* will **both** be selected, since
  they are both of type **JPEG Image**. Windows file types may be viewed
  by :doc:`enabling <../view/select_columns>` the *Type* column in the
  files pane. You may select by file name using the :doc:`Wildcard
  Select... <wildcard_select>` routine.
