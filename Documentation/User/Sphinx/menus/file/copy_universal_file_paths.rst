Copy Universal File Paths
-------------------------

This menu item behaves nearly identically to :doc:`Copy File Paths
<copy_file_paths>`, except that the paths to Network resources (ie.
files, printers, etc.) are always copied obeying Windows UNC (Universal
Naming Convention) rules.

UNC syntax for Windows systems has the generic form:

    ::

        \\ComputerName\SharedFolder\Resource, or
        \\Server\Volume\File

A sample listing (1 file) might look like

    ::

        \\Netbook\SharedDocs\My Pictures\Josh & Penny - house\IMG_0595.JPG
