Show Command Prompt
-------------------

This menu item opens a command prompt (ie. *DOS box*) in the current
directory. Executing command line commands can perform some tasks
quickly and easily. Note that this opens a 32 bit (ie. **cmd.exe**)
window rather than a 16 bit (ie. **command.com**) window.
