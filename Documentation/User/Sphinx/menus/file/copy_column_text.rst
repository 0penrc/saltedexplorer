Copy Column Text
----------------

The files pane displays file and folder information in columns, such as:

.. image:: /_static/images/mnu_file/column_headings_example.png

The :bolditalic:`Copy Column Text` function copies to the clipboard (as
plain, Unicode text)

- column headings and
- the text shown in each column, whether visible or not

for files that are currently selected. Copied text may be pasted into
another application, such as a word processor or text editor, using
**Paste** (**Ctrl+V**) from within that application. Text columns are
delimited by tab characters (09h), but columns may not *line up* in your
word processor or text editor, depending on the length of text in each
column.
