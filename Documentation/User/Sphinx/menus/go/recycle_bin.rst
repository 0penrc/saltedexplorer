Recycle Bin
-----------

This is a *virtual folder* that displays deleted files and folders from
various locations. This is the same **Recycle Bin** usually shown on
your :doc:`Desktop <desktop>`. Selected items may be restored by using
the "Restore" menu item on the context (ie. right-click) menu. Note that
files deleted from a **Local** USB (ie. external) drive will not be
visible in **Recycle Bin** unless the drive is physically and logically
connected to your system. Files deleted from a Removable USB drive (eg.
*flash* or *jump* drive) do not appear in the **Recycle Bin**.
