Desktop
-------

**Desktop** is a *virtual folder*, considered by Windows to be the
parent (ie. the topmost item in the hierarchy) of all items in the
*virtual tree* shown in the Folders pane. The practical use for
**Desktop** is that it always contains all items shown on the user's
actual desktop (ie. the Windows screen when no application windows are
visible).

Although **Desktop** is considered to be a virtual folder (for purposes
of the computer's *virtual tree*), it is really comprised of 2 real
folders

- *C:\\Documents and Settings\\<username>\\Desktop*, and
- *C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Desktop*

The (root) drive letter may vary with different installations of
Windows.
