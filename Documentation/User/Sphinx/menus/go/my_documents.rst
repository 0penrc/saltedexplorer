My Documents
------------

This is a real folder (probably
*C:\\Documents and Settings\\<username>\\My Documents* - drive letters
may vary) which Windows creates as part of its installation. The purpose
for this folder, at least as intended by Windows, is to act as a parent
folder for all the user's documents and data. This may not suit each
user's purposes, but many programs default to this location for data
storage.
