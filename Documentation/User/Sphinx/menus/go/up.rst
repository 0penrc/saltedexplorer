This menu item changes the address of the currently active tab to the
*parent* folder (or location), as shown in the Folders pane (providing
it is up to date).

The parent folder (or location) is the folder which contains the folder
currently displayed.

**If Up One Level** is disabled, the Files pane is currently displaying
the highest level available in the Folders pane (*virtual* tree) -
:doc:`Desktop <desktop>`.
