Printers and Faxes
------------------

This is a *virtual folder* which displays *links* to all printers and
faxes connected to your system. This location may also show drivers
which control various devices. The context (ie. right-click) menu for
each device or driver may show various control items including
:doc:`Properties <../file/properties>`, which usually allows some setup
procedures.
