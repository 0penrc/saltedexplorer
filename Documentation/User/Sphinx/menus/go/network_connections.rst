Network Connections
-------------------

This is a *virtual folder* which displays networks which your computer
is connected to, or *can* connect to.

.. admonition:: Incomplete

  **Network Connections** currently does not provide information about
  the *Type*, *Status* or *Owner* (available :ref:`columns
  <menus/view/select_columns:Network Connections>` for display). This
  information (and more) can be viewed by selecting **Control Panel** in
  the Folders pane, right clicking **Network Connections** in the Files
  pane (for the context menu), and selecting **Explore** - this opens
  Windows Explorer which will display this information.
