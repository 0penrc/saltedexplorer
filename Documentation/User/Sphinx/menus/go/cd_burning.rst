CD Burning
----------

Windows XP and higher (Vista, 7) has built-in routines for native
*burning* (ie. writing) of CDs. This burning requires a buffer where
data is kept that will be written to the CD; this buffer location is a
folder reserved especially for this purpose - "**CD Burning**". Files
and folders contained in this folder are slated for writing to CD, but
could be removed (ie. deleted) if necessary prior to the actual write.
