Control Panel
-------------

This is a *virtual folder* which displays various tools (ie. *applets*,
or small applications) used to configure your system or other
applications. Most *applets* are physically housed in the
WINDOWS\\system32 folder, but some may be elsewhere. This is the same
**Control Panel** usually shown on your *Start Menu*.
