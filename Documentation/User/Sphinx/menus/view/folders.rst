Folders
-------

This menu item toggles the visibility of the Folders pane. When the
**Folders pane** is hidden, its former window area is used by the Files
pane, allowing more columns (or wider columns) to be displayed.

Toggling the visibility of the **Folders pane** may also be done through
a button on the :doc:`Main toolbar <../../toolbars/main>`.
