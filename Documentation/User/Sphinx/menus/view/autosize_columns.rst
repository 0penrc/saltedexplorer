Autosize Columns
----------------

This menu item automatically resizes enabled columns to fit the data
shown in the Files pane, including items which must be scrolled into
view. Data items should fit exactly (no extra space) and should not be
truncated. This operation does not affect other tabs, or newly opened
tabs.

  **Autosize Columns** is not a *one-time* option setting - you may need
  to use this feature on other folders.
