Auto Arrange
------------

When displaying items using the :ref:`Thumbnails
<menus/view/view_modes:Thumbnails>`, :ref:`Tiles
<menus/view/view_modes:Tiles>`, :ref:`Icons
<menus/view/view_modes:Icons>` or :ref:`Small Icons
<menus/view/view_modes:Small Icons>` methods, items are normally
displayed in *orderly* columns, laid out according to available width in
the Files pane. Checking the **Auto Arrange** menu item enforces this
requirement.

When **Auto Arrange** is unchecked, items may be dragged to positions
outside the columns allowing the user to visually organize the pane to
his liking. This is not a permanent re-ordering; the effect is merely
visual.

If the view is changed, for example from **Thumbnails** to **Icons**,
the items are initially organized in columns even if **Auto Arrange** is
not enabled.

The following image demonstrates what can be done with **Auto Arrange**
turned off (disabled).
