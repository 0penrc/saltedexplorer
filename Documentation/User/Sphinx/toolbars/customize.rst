The **Customize Toolbar** dialog manages buttons on the :doc:`Main
<main>` toolbar by

- adding a button
- removing a button or separator bar
- re-ordering buttons.

Available toolbar buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This pane shows the toolbar buttons that are available, ie. have not
been included in the current toolbar configuration. The *Separator* item
is always available. For more information on available buttons, see the
:doc:`Main <main>` toolbar.

Clicking this button adds the currently selected tool (in the
**Available** pane) to the toolbar. The button is inserted above the
selected item in the **Current** pane.

**Available** pane, but is no longer shown on the toolbar.
