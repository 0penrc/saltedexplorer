Lock Toolbars
-------------

This menu item - whether on the *Main* menu (*View/Toolbars*), or on the
context menu of one of the toolbars themselves - toggles the **locked**
state of all toolbars.

- **Locked** - toolbars are not movable, and have no grips (see
  :ref:`Moving toolbars <toolbars/index:Moving toolbars>` for image of
  *grip*)
- **Unlocked** - all toolbars have grips, and are movable.

Although it does not affect functionality, it is recommended that
toolbars are locked, once positioned, to avoid any accidental movement,
etc.

.. tip::

  The :doc:`Main toolbar <main>` may be :doc:`customized <customize>`,
  even in the locked state.
